Description: LassoBag provides an implementation of a CART frame for
    selecting markers from multiple models. Several methods (Parametrical Statistical Test, Curve Elbow Point Detection and Permutation Test) 
    are provided to aid the cutoff point decision for the importance measure (i.e. observed selected frequency) of each variable, while each method is 
    based on different theoratical ground and may be optimal to be applied in different conditions.
